Gentlemen, start your engines!!!

I'm Mr.Rider baby
I'm turbo rider baby
Hurry up and go faster, faster
Baby start my engine!

Now I feel my life in tension
Jump into the disco, ready for the fashion
Can't you see the night is lighter
Come on take me higher, don't you leave me drier

Oh, oh, oh, ready to go
Power power, kiss me like a fire
Oh, oh, oh, asking for more
Power power, take me with desire

I'm a rider
Super rider
Take me up and faster in the night
I'm your rider
Turbo rider
Feel the power driving through the light
I'm a rider
Super rider
Hurry up go faster in the night
I'm your rider
Mr. Rider
Baby drive the night it's all right

Now I feel my life extension
Ready for the disco, dressing like confession
Con you beat my heart as runner
Come on take me higher, baby I'm Mr. Rider

I'm Mr. Rider baby
I'm turbo rider baby
Hurry up go faster faster faster
C'mon!
